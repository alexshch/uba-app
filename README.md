# User Behavior Analytics (UBA) Project

## Overview
The User Behavior Analytics (UBA) project aims to develop a neural network-based system that analyzes user behavior to determine if subsequent actions belong to the same user or a different one. The model is trained on various user events, including authentication times, IP addresses, terminal commands, and service/process names.

```

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd uba-app
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure the `config.yaml` file with appropriate settings for your environment, including model parameters and file paths.

## Usage
1. **Preprocessing Data**: Use the `src/data/preprocess.py` to clean and prepare your user event data for training.

2. **Training the Model**: Run the training script to train the UBA model:
   ```
   python src/train.py
   ```

3. **Making Predictions**: After training, use the prediction script to evaluate new user events:
   ```
   python src/predict.py
   ```

## Example
- To preprocess data, you can call the functions defined in `preprocess.py` to load and clean your dataset.
- The trained model can be evaluated with new user events to check for anomalies or confirm user identity.
